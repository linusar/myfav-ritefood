<h2><u><font color="green">Steps in preparing the Recipe</font></u></h2>
<ol><li>Clean the ginger and garlic, pound or blended together.
The seed of ehu is one of the most relevant ingredients<br> just go ahead and break away the outer shell, 
then go ahead and blend/pound together with the uziza seeds and half cup of crayfish</li>
<li>Slice the onions and utazi leaves and set aside in a plate.</li>
<li>Start cooking the meat with some simple ingredients. (A seasoning cube, a teaspoon of Salt
    and half cup of sliced onions).
</li><li>Cook the meat for just 10 minutes then add about 3 cups of water and cook for 30-50 minutes<br>
until the meat becomes tender and easy to chew. You can add another cup of water</li>
<li>Add the pepper soup spice, the ground ehu, uziza, crayfish, and remaining onions.</li>
<li>Add the paprika - a teaspoon. Paprika is a spice made from the dried fruit of red bell pepper.<br>
It makes my pepper soup somewhat reddish.</li>
<li>Add the sliced utazi, salt and (ordinary) pepper to taste. Allow to boil for another 5-10 minutes<br>
and you just made a delicious pot of Peppersoup, one of Nigeria's most popular evening meals.</li></ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> <em><font color="purple">seeds are very peppery, be sure to taste before adding scotch bonnet (ordinary pepper).<br>
You can serve the pepper soup with a chilled bottle of your favourite drink. Although, I enjoy it better<br>
with boiled white rice or yam.</font></em></p><br>
